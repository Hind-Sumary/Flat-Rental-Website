# Birzeit Flat Rent Website

## Project Overview

This repository contains the full-stack implementation of the 'Birzeit Flat Rent' website, a comprehensive platform designed for flat searching, renting, and management. Developed as an individual project during a web development course, this application showcases both front-end and back-end development skills. The project was completed within approximately three days of on-and-off work, demonstrating rapid prototyping and development capabilities.

The Project had no restriction for the main color palette so you would notice a unique and creative color palette, notably incorporating pinkish tones (my favourite color). It caters to three distinct user types: Regular Customers, Flat Owners, and Managers, each with tailored functionalities to ensure a seamless and secure experience.

The course Project specified that every deliverable must be a PHP file that contains the page’s HTML inline. For that reason you’ll see mostly .php files in this repo — but those files contain the actual HTML pages (templated and mixed with PHP logic) rather than separate .html files. This structure was used to meet the assignment requirements while keeping each page self-contained.

## Features

### General / Public Access Features

Users without an account can still browse available flats and view detailed information about each listing. However, certain interactive features, such as requesting appointments or initiating rental processes, are restricted to registered users, prompting them to log in or register when attempting such actions.
